	      	Sketch and Shake is a simple drawing app that allows you to draw with your finger,
	      	and then when you want to erase simply shake you phone (just like an Etch and Sketch).
	      	It was created during Experience Microsoft, a three day program at Microsoft's Headquarters
	      	in Bellevue, WA. This is my first Windows Phone 7 App, and has been featured on
