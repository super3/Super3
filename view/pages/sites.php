		<h2>A Little About Development</h2>
		<p>
			Below is a collection of my websites that are currently live. All are built using
			HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. More recently I have been redesigning them using HTML5,
			and an awesome HTML, CSS, and Javascript framework called
			<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Boostrap</a>. In fact, the site you 
			are viewing now was built with Bootstrap. I am currently playing around with more 
			development using Bootstrap, and hope to release a starter template set for those
			who use Bootstrap too. If you have an ideas for starter templates or would like
			to help, feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.
